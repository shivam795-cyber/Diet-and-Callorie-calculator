🥗 Calorie Calculator (Python Project)

This project involves a simple calorie calculator built with Python. It helps figure out daily calorie needs for people. The tool relies on the Harris-Benedict formula to calculate basal metabolic rate. From there, it shows calories for maintaining weight, gaining some, or losing a bit.

📍 Features

The features include taking inputs from users. Those cover gender, age, weight, and height. It also factors in physical activity levels. Options range from sedentary lifestyles to light, moderate, or active ones. The calculator then works out the BMR. It gives daily maintenance calories too. Plus, it adjusts for goals like gaining or losing weight. Overall, this makes it easy for beginners. It draws from actual health formulas people use.

🧮 Formula Used

The formula splits by gender. For males, BMR comes out as 88.36 plus 13.4 times weight in kilograms. Add 4.8 times height in centimeters. Then subtract 5.7 times age in years. For females, it starts at 447.6. Add 9.2 times weight in kilograms. Include 3.1 times height in centimeters. Subtract 4.3 times age in years. Activity levels multiply the BMR by specific factors. Sedentary uses 1.2. Light exercise goes with 1.375. Moderate exercise takes 1.55. Very active hits 1.725

 🚀How to Run the Program

To run the program, first install Python if you do not have it yet. Save the code into a file called calorie_calculator.py. Open a terminal or use VS Code. Then type python calorie_calculator.py to start it.

📌 Output Example

Here is an example of the output. It shows Calorie Calc. Then G for gender, M or F. Say M. A for age in years, like 22. W for weight in kg, such as 65. H for height in cm, around 170. Act for activity. Options list as 1 for Sed, no exercise. 2 for Lite, 1 to 3 times a week. 3 for Mod, 3 to 5 times a week. 4 for Act, 6 to 7 times a week. Pick 3. Results give BMR at 1600.50 calories per day. Keep weight needs 2480.77 calories per day. Lose shows minus 400 to 600 calories.

🎯 Real-World Use Cases

Real-world uses fit fitness tracking apps. They help with diet and weight management. Health monitoring systems benefit too.

📂 Project Structure

The project structure keeps things simple. It has a folder named Calorie-Calculator. Inside sits calorie_calculator.py as the main code. README.md handles the documentation.
